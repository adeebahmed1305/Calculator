# Calculator
This project aims to create a simple command-line calculator application using Python. The calculator will support basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user will be able to input two numbers and an operator, and the calculator will output the result of the operation. The application will be designed to be user-friendly and easy to use, with clear instructions and error messages for invalid inputs. I will also be using python's built in library tkinter to create a GUI for this calculator.
